Here are 20 advanced-level interview questions on socket programming to test candidates deep understanding of the topic:

1. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP sockets in terms of reliability, connection, and data transmission. How does socket programming differ for each?

2. What is the significance of the SO_REUSEADDR socket option, and when would you use it?

3. What is the difference between a blocking socket and a non-blocking socket? How would you convert a blocking socket into a non-blocking one in Linux?

4. Explain the purpose of select(), poll(), and epoll(). When would you prefer one over the other, and why?

5. What are the potential pitfalls of using the select() system call, and how does epoll() address them?

6. In a socket server handling multiple clients, how do you handle multiple connections without blocking other connections? Discuss the options available.

7. What are the common socket errors like EAGAIN, EINTR, ECONNRESET, and EPIPE? How should your socket program handle them?

8. Explain the role of the backlog parameter in the listen() system call. What happens when this backlog queue is full?

9. Describe how the SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF socket options impact the performance of a socket. How would you tune these buffers for high-throughput applications?

10. How does the Nagle’s algorithm work, and when would you want to disable it using the TCP_NODELAY option?

11. Explain how a TCP socket establishes a connection using the three-way handshake. What happens if the client sends data before the handshake is complete?

12. What happens if a client closes its connection without reading the data from the server? What error would the server encounter, and how should it handle this situation?

13. Describe the process of connection teardown in TCP using the four-way handshake. How does the FIN and ACK sequence work during connection termination? What happens if one party doesn’t respond to the FIN?

14. What is the difference between half-close and full-close in TCP sockets? How would you implement a half-close operation, and when is it useful?

15. What is the purpose of the SO_LINGER socket option? How does it affect the behavior of close() on a socket, particularly when there is data in the buffer?

16. Explain what happens when you call shutdown() on a socket. How is it different from close(), and in what scenarios would you use shutdown()?

17. How would you implement a timeout mechanism on socket operations such as recv() or accept()? What are the advantages of using the SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO options versus select() for timeouts?

18. What is the TCP_KEEPALIVE socket option, and why is it important for long-lived connections? How can you configure keep-alive settings in a socket program?

19. Describe how IPv6 socket programming differs from IPv4. What changes in address structure and socket creation do you need to account for in a dual-stack application?

20. What are some common strategies for scaling a server that handles thousands of concurrent socket connections? Discuss event-driven I/O, multi-threading, and multi-processing approaches.
